## Deployment

All the INDIe back end components are based on a microservices solution based on Spring Boot(https://spring.io/microservices). The deployment of these microservices depends on the selected cloud computing provider. Each cloud computing provider provides its own deployment manual. In the case of Microsoft’s Azure it can be found at the following URL  Quickstart - Deploy your first application to Azure Spring Apps | Microsoft Docs (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/quickstart?tabs=Azure-CLI).

## Creators and contributors

INDIeOpen component files have been created at the **Digital Content Creation Center** (CPCD), in the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena.
